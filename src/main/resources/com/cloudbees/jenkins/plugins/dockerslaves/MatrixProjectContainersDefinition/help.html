Uses Docker container to host the build environment and run build steps.
Using this option, you have full control on your build environment to make it fully reproducible and isolated
from other builds.
This option allows you to use <i>arbitrary</i> docker image using the assigned label, setup with the builds tools required by your job.
<strong>The assigned label must follow the docker:<i>image</i>[:<i>tag</i>] format.</strong>
There's <u>no</u> prerequisites on the docker image as the jenkins infrastructure setup is handled transparently.
